                        The trombone Slide is the most important part of the trombone. The quality of the Slide directly
                        determines whether the whole trombone is used smoothly. Poor quality Slides are easy to deform
                        and oxidize, and are easy to get stuck in the process of practice.
                        <br><br>
                        Origano inner Slide adopts brass chrome plating process, with higher hardness, higher
                        brightness, more wear resistance and also, faster reaction speed when playing.

                        Long brushes can clean stains in U-shaped tubes. The short brush can clean the stains in the
                        mouthpiece and short pipe. Oil can lubricate the slices (professional slide oil is recommended
                        for higher maintenance). Joint grease plays a role in lubricating and sealing the necessary
                        interfaces.

                        b) Origano's hard case provides good supporting for musicians to keep their trombones or go out
                        to perform.
